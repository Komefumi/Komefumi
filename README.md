# Welcome

My name in real life is Arjun.

I'm someone who is working towards becoming an application developer agnostic of the platform. I've a desire to someday engineer solutions that draw heavily upon expertise in Mathematics and the classical Sciences aside from Computer Science.

I'm a self taught programmer - most of my experience has been on the front-end with React. JavaScript is the language I have most comfort in. I've worked with Node, Angular, Ionic, and also, non-professional with Svelte and Vue.

I'm currently working on becoming capable of building websites rapidly. Primarily intending to do front-end freelance work, as soon as possible. I'm also learning the Go programming language, sparing time where possible.

I'm pursuing a BSc. in Mathematics from [Singhania University](https://singhaniauniversity.co.in/). I take my studies seriously and see it in line with what I want to do in the world.
