# Welcome

My legal name is 'Arjun' but my name is Hafiz...

I'm a self taught developer. After going through a period of stagnation of roughly three years, I'm following my passions. Along with a revitalized interest in programming, computer science, and even mathematics, I'm also interested in the conventional sciences. My path to it will need to be written out by me.

Besides this, I have a deep interest in language, and culture - Arab and Persian influenced ones in particular.

Feel free to reach me by email, it will be in my profile outside this bio. To the left, if you are on desktop

This is all for now. This will be updated with more details in future.
