# Welcome

My legal name is 'Arjun' but my name is Hafiz...

I'm a self taught developer. After going through a period of stagnation of roughly three years, I'm following my passions. Along with a revitalized interest in programming, computer science, and even mathematics, I'm also interested in the conventional sciences. My path to it will need to be written out by me.

Besides this, I have a deep interest in language, and culture - Arab and Persian influenced ones in particular.

If you'd like to contact me, my email is `komefumi@protonmail.ch`

This is all for now. This will be updated with more details in future.

"**Khuda Hafiz**"
